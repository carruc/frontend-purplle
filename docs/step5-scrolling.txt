# PurpLLE Development Changes Summary

## Recent Implementations (February 2024)

### 1. Project Data Management
- Implemented mock API in `src/lib/api/projects.ts`
  - Created 22 mock projects (2 detailed + 20 exam projects)
  - Added sorting functionality (alphabetical, deadline, recent)
  - Implemented pagination support
  - Added simulated network delay for realistic testing

- Created `useProjects` hook in `src/lib/hooks/useProjects.ts`
  - Manages project data fetching
  - Handles loading and error states
  - Supports sorting and pagination
  - Uses mock userId ("user123") for development

### 2. Sidebar Improvements
- Implemented new `ProjectListSidebar` component with:
  - Sticky "+" button within scrollable area
  - Project entries with emoji indicators
  - Proper overflow handling
  - Search functionality
  - Visual hierarchy with indentation

- Structured sidebar into three sections:
  1. Fixed header (logo, homepage button, search)
  2. Scrollable projects list (90% width, right-aligned)
  3. Fixed footer (copyright)

### 3. Viewport Management
- Implemented viewport constraints in root layout:
  ```tsx
  // src/app/layout.tsx
  <html className="h-full">
    <body className="h-full overflow-hidden">
      <div className="flex h-full">
        <Sidebar />
        <main className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
  ```

- Each major section handles its own scrolling:
  - Sidebar projects list: `overflow-y-auto`
  - Main content area: `overflow-y-auto`
  - No global page scroll

### 4. Component Structure
- Homepage (`src/app/homepage/page.tsx`):
  - Uses `useProjects` hook
  - Implements loading skeletons
  - Error handling
  - Responsive grid layout

- Projects Page (`src/app/projects/page.tsx`):
  - Currently using mock data directly
  - Pending update to use `useProjects` hook
  - Needs loading states and error handling

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Visual hierarchy in sidebar
- Loading states with skeleton components
- Proper error handling and feedback
- Responsive design considerations

## Pending Tasks
1. Update Projects page to use `useProjects` hook
2. Implement proper authentication and user context
3. Replace mock API with real backend integration
4. Add proper error boundaries
5. Implement project creation workflow
6. Add proper testing

## Technical Decisions

### API Design
- Included pagination and sorting in API design for scalability
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implemented proper error handling

### Component Architecture
- Used React Server Components where possible
- Client components marked with "use client"
- Proper prop typing and interface definitions
- Consistent component structure

### Styling Approach
- Used Tailwind CSS exclusively
- Consistent class naming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- ShadcnUI components for UI elements

## Notes for Future Development
1. The mock API in `projects.ts` simulates realistic backend behavior
2. The `useProjects` hook is designed to be easily extended for real API integration
3. Viewport management ensures no global scrolling
4. Project list components are designed to handle large datasets
5. Current font is Geist (previously changed from Inter)

## Environment Setup
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ShadcnUI components
- Proper viewport constraints

## Testing
When implementing new features, ensure:
1. Proper loading states
2. Error handling
3. Responsive design
4. Accessibility
5. Performance with large datasets
